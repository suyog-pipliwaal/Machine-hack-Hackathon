## Aim
To build a a binary classification model to determine wheather a image contain a watermark or not. 

## Dataset Description
Training dataset contain 15933 image in which 8961 has no watermark and 6972 has watermark. First I try to solve this problem using classical machine learning classfication algorithms and the CNN based model for classification. 

Using machine learning algorthims I encounter the problem of space as feature vector is too large to fit in memory.

Using deep learning I got Training Acc of 0.8579 on traning dataset and on test dataset I got accuracy of 0.83455

The final result was **rank 18** on Leaderboard
